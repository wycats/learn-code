# The Vision of Kibi

**Kibi** is a "Thinking Magic" engine designed to teach computational thinking to pre-readers (ages 3-6) through a tactile, diegetic interface. It is not just a coding game; it is a **digital playground** where the rules of logic are as tangible as the blocks in a toy chest.

## The Core Philosophy: "Thinking Magic"

We believe that coding is the closest thing we have to real magic. It is the ability to speak a language that the world (the computer) understands and obeys. In Kibi, we strip away the syntax and the screens full of text to reveal the _structure_ of that magic.

- **Stop & Go**: We separate "Thinking Time" (Architect Mode) from "Doing Time" (Run Mode). This teaches the fundamental difference between _writing_ code and _executing_ it.
- **Strictly Typed Reality**: The world has rules. Water is wet. Fire is hot. Loops need numbers. By enforcing these rules visually and physically (through drag-and-drop constraints), we teach type safety without ever saying the word "Type".
- **Diegetic Learning**: There is no "HUD". There are no "Popups". The tutorial is a character (The Guide). The manual is a book (The Field Guide). The level editor is a tool used by a character (The Architect). Everything exists _inside_ the world.

## The Narrative: The Kibi Chronicles

The experience is framed as a dialogue between two modes of thinking, personified by our protagonists:

- **Zoey (The Explorer)**: She represents the **Runtime**. She is eager, active, and lives in the moment. She wants to _do_. She runs the code.
- **Jonas (The Architect)**: He represents the **Editor**. He is thoughtful, structural, and sees the big picture. He wants to _build_. He writes the code.

The user plays as **The Apprentice**, learning from both Jonas and Zoey to master the "Thinking Magic" and reshape the world.

## The Product: A Living Toy

Kibi is built to feel like a high-quality digital toy.

- **Touch-First**: Every interaction is designed for chubby fingers and clumsy taps.
- **Visual & Audio Feedback**: Every action has a reaction. Blocks click, snap, and pop. The world hums with life.
- **Offline & Private**: We respect the user. No tracking, no ads, no always-on requirement. The magic happens on the device.

## The Future: Community & Creation

We are building towards a future where Kibi is not just a set of levels, but a platform for creation.

- **The Builder**: Every user is an Architect. The tools we use to build levels are the same tools we give to the users.
- **The Library**: A shared space where Apprentices can swap stories (levels) and learn from each other.
