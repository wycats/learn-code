## Phase 1: Foundation & Research (Completed)

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Summary:**
Established the pedagogical and technical foundation for "Wonderblocks". Defined the core "Stop & Go" mechanics, researched prior art (Cubetto, ScratchJr), and established the "Modern Matte" visual style. Set up the SvelteKit project structure with Open Props for styling and a custom "Mimic" interpreter architecture.

**Key Deliverables:**

- `docs/design/mechanics.md`: Core game mechanics definition.
- `docs/design/visual-style.md`: Visual design system (Modern Matte).
- `docs/design/personas.md`: User personas (Zoey, Jonas).
- `docs/agent-context/current/technical-architecture.md`: Technical stack and architecture.
- Project Skeleton: SvelteKit app with Open Props and "Every Layout" primitives.

## Phase 2: Modern CSS Foundation (Completed)

**Date:** November 27, 2025

**Summary:**
Established a robust, future-proof styling architecture using Baseline 2025 features. Implemented the "Modern Matte" aesthetic using Open Props and semantic tokens with `light-dark()` for native dark mode support. Refined layout primitives and created a "Kitchen Sink" page to validate the design system.

**Key Deliverables:**

- `src/app.css`: Global styles with `@layer`, semantic tokens, and `light-dark()`.
- `src/lib/components/layout/Switch.svelte`: New layout primitive using Container Queries.
- `src/routes/design/+page.svelte`: Kitchen Sink / Style Guide page.
- Refined `Stack`, `Grid`, `Cluster`, `Center`, `Box` components.
