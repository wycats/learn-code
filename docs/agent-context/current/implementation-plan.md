# Phase 13 Implementation Plan: Design & Reflection

## Goal

To ground the project's future development in a deep understanding of its users (Personas) and its fundamental principles (Axioms). This phase is about "thinking" and "defining" rather than just "building".

## Strategy

We will proceed in three distinct steps, engaging in a dialogue for each:

1.  **Persona Enrichment**: We will revisit `docs/design/personas.md`. We will analyze how the introduction of the **Builder** (Phase 7-12) impacts our personas. For example, Jonas is no longer just a _player_; he is now an _architect_. How does that change his needs? We will also refine the "Co-Pilot" personas.
2.  **Fresh Eyes Review**: We will "roleplay" as each persona and walk through the current application (Game, Library, Builder). We will document friction points and "magic moments" in a new `docs/design/fresh-eyes.md` document.
3.  **The Constitution (Axioms)**: We will draft `docs/design/axioms.md`. This will not be a list of features, but a list of _laws_ (e.g., "The Law of Direct Manipulation", "The Law of No Magic"). These axioms will serve as the tie-breaker for future design decisions.

## Deliverables

- Updated `docs/design/personas.md`
- New `docs/design/fresh-eyes.md` (Review findings)
- Populated `docs/design/axioms.md`
