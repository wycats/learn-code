# Phase 10: The Librarian - Walkthrough

## Overview
In this phase, we are reorganizing the game's content into "Level Packs" (Campaigns) and redesigning the home screen to support this new hierarchy. This moves us away from a flat list of levels towards a more structured, game-like progression system.

## Key Changes

### 1. Data Architecture
