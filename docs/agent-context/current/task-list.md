# Phase 2 Task List: Modern CSS Foundation

## Goal

Establish a robust, future-proof styling architecture using Baseline 2025 features (Open Props, Semantic Tokens, Dark Mode).

## Tasks

### 1. CSS Architecture & Tokens

- [ ] Create a semantic token layer (Brand, Surface, Text) mapping to Open Props.
- [ ] Implement Dark Mode using `light-dark()` and `color-scheme`.
- [ ] Organize global styles using CSS `@layer`.

### 2. Layout Primitives Refinement

- [ ] Review and refine "Every Layout" components (Stack, Cluster, Grid, etc.) to ensure they use modern logical properties and best practices.
- [ ] Add a `Switch` layout primitive (for switching between horizontal/vertical based on container width - using Container Queries).

### 3. Design System Validation

- [ ] Create a "Kitchen Sink" page (`/design`) to visualize all tokens and components.
- [ ] Verify "Modern Matte" aesthetic in both Light and Dark modes.
