# Axiom 3: Creation is Social

**Code is a medium for human connection.**

## Principle

A creation that cannot be shared is a dead end. The joy of making is amplified by the joy of showing.

## Application

- **Shareable by Default**: Every level created must be exportable.
- **Portable Formats**: Use standard formats (JSON, QR Codes) that work across devices and without accounts.
- **Remix Culture**: Encourage users to open others' levels, see how they work, and modify them.
- **Real Tools**: Prefer open ecosystems (GitHub) over walled gardens. The "Ceiling" of sharing is a Pull Request.

## Anti-Pattern

- A "Save" button that only writes to `localStorage` with no export option.
- Walled gardens where content is locked to a specific user account.
- Proprietary cloud storage that disappears if the company shuts down.
