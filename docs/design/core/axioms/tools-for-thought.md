# Axiom 6: Tools for Thought, Not Just Tasks

**The interface should help the user _think_.**

## Principle

Offload cognitive load to the UI. The tool should be a scaffold for the mind, visualizing hidden states and relationships.

## Application

- **Zoey (Novice)**: Use icons instead of text. Use shape and color to indicate compatibility.
- **Jonas (Architect)**: Use "Ghost Blocks" to suggest patterns. Visualize variable states (Thought Bubbles).
- **Facilitator**: Show the "Solution Path" or "Debug View" to help them guide the child.

## Anti-Pattern

- Hidden state that the user has to track in their head.
- "Guess the verb" interfaces.
