# Axiom: Strictly Typed Reality

**"The physics of the world are the types of the code."**

## The Law

The game world is a strictly typed system. Visual metaphors must map 1:1 to underlying data structures and constraints. If two things look different, they _are_ different types. If two things look the same, they _are_ the same type.

## Why?

1.  **Intuition**: Children learn physics before they learn logic. By mapping types to physical properties (shape, color, behavior), we leverage their existing intuition.
2.  **Error Prevention**: We prevent "Syntax Errors" by making them physically impossible. You cannot put a "Square" block in a "Round" hole.
3.  **Discoverability**: The UI should communicate what is possible. If a drop zone pulses, it accepts the type you are holding.

## Implications

- **Visual Distinctiveness**: Different types (Numbers, Actions, Conditions) must have distinct shapes or colors.
- **No Hidden State**: The state of the program (and the world) should be visible. If a variable holds a value, that value should be visually represented (e.g., the "Thought Bubble").
- **Fail Fast, Fail Visually**: If an interaction is invalid, it should be rejected immediately with clear visual feedback (e.g., the block snaps back), rather than failing at runtime.
