# Axiom 13: The Two Minds (Stop & Go)

**Thinking without Action is paralysis. Action without Thinking is chaos.**

## Principle

The pedagogy is built on the dialectic between **GO** (Action, Tinkering, Perseverance) and **STOP** (Logic, Planning, Evaluation).

## Application

- **Character Embodiment**: The UI should reinforce these modes. The "Run" button is Green (Go). The "Edit" mode is Red/Calm (Stop).
- **Cycle of Learning**: The gameplay loop should encourage switching between these modes. Plan -> Run -> Fail -> Debug -> Plan.
- **Celebration**: We celebrate both the "Go" (trying) and the "Stop" (solving).

## Anti-Pattern

- A system that only rewards the "correct" answer and hides the process.
- Discouraging trial and error.
