# Axiom 7: Touch First, Mouse Second

**The finger is the primary input device.**

## Principle

If it feels clunky on an iPad, it is broken. We design for the clumsiness and intimacy of touch.

## Application

- **Target Size**: Minimum touch target size is 44px.
- **No Hover**: No critical functionality can depend on hover. Hover is for delight only.
- **Occlusion**: Design for the hand covering the screen. Drag-and-drop proxies should be offset or large enough to be seen.
- **Equivalence**: A mouse is just a very precise finger. It should not unlock "Pro" features that touch users can't access.

## Anti-Pattern

- Tooltips that contain critical information.
- Tiny "X" buttons.
- Right-click menus as the only way to access actions.
