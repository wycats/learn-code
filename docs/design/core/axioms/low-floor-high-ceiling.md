# Axiom 2: Low Floor, High Ceiling, Wide Walls

**Inspired by Seymour Papert and Mitch Resnick.**

## Low Floor

**Easy to start.** A 4-year-old (Zoey) must be able to play the first level without reading instructions.

- **No Setup**: The app loads instantly.
- **Intuitive UI**: Icons over text. Direct manipulation.
- **Forgiving**: No "Game Over". Just "Try Again".

## High Ceiling

**Room to grow.** A 7-year-old (Jonas) should be able to build complex logic puzzles and express sophisticated ideas.

- **Advanced Logic**: Support for loops, variables, functions, and conditionals.
- **System Depth**: The interactions between elements (e.g., Ice + Speed) allow for emergent complexity.

## Wide Walls

**Many paths.** Support diverse creative expressions.

- **Not Just Logic**: Some kids want to build hard puzzles. Others want to tell stories. Others want to make pixel art maps.
- **Multiple Solutions**: Levels should rarely have only one "correct" code solution.

## Anti-Pattern

- A "tutorial" that feels like a lecture.
- Locking advanced tools behind arbitrary grind.
