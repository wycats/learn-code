# Axiom 1: Story is the Engine

**Logic is the fuel, but Story is the destination.**

## Principle

We are not teaching "loops"; we are teaching "how to make the robot dance forever." The abstract concept must always serve a narrative goal.

## Application

- **Narrative Context**: Every level must have a "Why". Why are we moving? To get the key. Why do we need the key? To open the door for the lost cat.
- **Diegetic Instructions**: Instructions should come from characters in the world, not disembodied text boxes.
- **Emotional Payoff**: Completing a level should advance the story or result in a humorous animation, not just a "Level Complete" badge.

## Anti-Pattern

- Abstract puzzles with no characters or motivation (e.g., "Move the arrow to (3,4)").
- "Because I said so" tutorials.
