# Axiom 14: The Kinetic Bridge

**From the body to the screen.**

## Principle

Coding is not just a mental activity; it is a physical one. We bridge the gap between "Unplugged" play (acting out code) and "Digital" execution.

## Application

- **Physical Metaphors**: Blocks snap like LEGOs. Variables are held in a "Thought Bubble".
- **Embodied Logic**: The character's movement mirrors the child's understanding of space (Forward, Turn).
- **Direct Manipulation**: We prefer dragging and placing over typing and selecting.

## Anti-Pattern

- Abstract syntax that has no physical correlate.
- Disconnected logic (e.g., typing "move(10)" without seeing the movement).
