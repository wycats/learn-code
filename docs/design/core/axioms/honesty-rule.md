# Axiom 4: The "Mario Maker" Rule (Honesty)

**You cannot share what you cannot solve.**

## Principle

The creator must prove solvability. This ensures fairness and prevents the proliferation of broken or impossible content.

## Application

- **Verification Run**: The Builder must enforce a successful playthrough by the creator before generating a share code/link.
- **Proof of Work**: The solution used to verify the level is attached to the level data (as a "Staff Ghost" or reference solution).

## Reasoning

- **Player Trust**: Players trust that if a level exists, it is beatable.
- **Creator Empathy**: It forces the creator to experience their own design, often revealing friction points they missed.

## Anti-Pattern

- Allowing upload/share immediately after placing the goal.
