# Axiom 5: Failure is Information

**Errors are not punishments; they are clues.**

## Principle

The system should never say "Wrong." It should say "Here is what happened."

## Application

- **Visual Execution**: Stepping through code visually allows the user to see _where_ the logic diverged from their intent.
- **Scaffolded Hints**: Hints should not give the answer. They should nudge (Level 1), then clue (Level 2), then explain (Level 3).
- **No Penalty**: There are no "lives" to lose in the learning mode. Retry is instant and free.

## Anti-Pattern

- A red "X" with no explanation.
- "Syntax Error" messages that require a CS degree to understand.
- Punishing experimentation (e.g., long reset times).
