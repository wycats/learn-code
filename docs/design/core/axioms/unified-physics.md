# Axiom 12: Unified Interaction Physics

**Touch and Mouse are citizens of the same world.**

## Principle

The interaction model is unified, not bifurcated. The physics of the interface should feel consistent regardless of the input method.

## Application

- **Equivalence**: All drags work as touch moves, and vice versa.
- **Mediation**: All drag operations are mediated through a "Move" operation.
- **Click-Click**: Every drag operation must have a click-click equivalent. If you can drag to trash, you must be able to click to select and then click trash.

## Anti-Pattern

- Features that only work with a specific input device.
- Draggable elements that cannot be moved by clicking.
