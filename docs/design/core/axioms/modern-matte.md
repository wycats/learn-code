# Axiom 8: Modern Matte & Diegetic UI

**The interface should feel like a physical toy, not a website.**

## Principle

"Modern Matte" aesthetic—flat, tactile, low-glare. The UI exists "in the world".

## Application

- **Tactility**: Buttons should look pressable. Blocks should look stackable.
- **Diegesis**: UI elements should exist in the game world where possible. The "Guide" is a character, not a modal. The "Tray" is a physical box, not a `<div>`.
- **Motion**: Motion conveys meaning (e.g., a block "snaps" into place, a variable "flies" into the thought bubble).

## Anti-Pattern

- Glossy "Web 2.0" gradients.
- System alerts (`window.alert`).
- Jarring modal popups that break immersion.
