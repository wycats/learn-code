# Design Axioms (The Constitution)

These axioms guide every design decision in the project. When in doubt, refer to these principles.

## Core Pedagogy

- [**1. Story is the Engine**](axioms/story-is-engine.md): Logic is the fuel, but Story is the destination.
- [**2. Low Floor, High Ceiling, Wide Walls**](axioms/low-floor-high-ceiling.md): Accessible to all, deep enough for experts.
- [**5. Failure is Information**](axioms/failure-is-information.md): Errors are clues, not punishments.
- [**13. The Two Minds (Stop & Go)**](axioms/stop-and-go.md): Balancing action and planning.
- [**14. The Kinetic Bridge**](axioms/kinetic-bridge.md): Connecting physical play to digital logic.
- [**15. Strictly Typed Reality**](axioms/strict-reality.md): The physics of the world are the types of the code.

## Interaction Design

- [**6. Tools for Thought**](axioms/tools-for-thought.md): The UI should help the user think.
- [**7. Touch First, Mouse Second**](axioms/touch-first.md): Designed for the intimacy of touch.
- [**8. Modern Matte & Diegetic UI**](axioms/modern-matte.md): A physical toy, not a website.
- [**12. Unified Interaction Physics**](axioms/unified-physics.md): Consistent physics across input methods.

## Engineering & Ethics

- [**3. Creation is Social**](axioms/creation-is-social.md): Code is a medium for connection.
- [**4. The "Mario Maker" Rule**](axioms/honesty-rule.md): You cannot share what you cannot solve.
- [**9. Zero Backend, Local First**](axioms/local-first.md): The user owns their data.
- [**10. Schema Stability**](axioms/schema-stability.md): No breaking changes.
- [**11. Native Modality & Layering**](axioms/native-modality.md): Respect the browser platform.
- [**16. Tooling Parity (Dogfooding)**](axioms/tooling-parity.md): If it's good enough for the user, it's good enough for us.
