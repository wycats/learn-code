# Design Documents

This directory contains design documents, philosophy, and analysis for the project, organized by "Epochs" of development.

## Core Philosophy (`core/`)

The immutable laws and guiding principles of the project.

- [The Constitution (Axioms)](core/axioms.md): The immutable laws guiding our design decisions.
- [Pedagogy (Kibi)](core/kibi-pedagogy.md): The core educational philosophy and framework.
- [Personas](core/personas.md): The target audience (Learners and Facilitators).
- [Builder Philosophy](core/builder-philosophy.md): The guiding principles for the Level Builder tools.
- [Terminology](core/terminology.md): Standardized naming conventions.
- [Visual Style](core/visual-style.md): The "Modern Matte" design language and principles.
- [Core Mechanics](core/mechanics.md): The game rules, interaction modes, and MVP scope.

## Epoch 1: Foundation & MVP (`epoch-1-foundation/`)

Phases 1-6: Establishing the engine, basic mechanics, and first curriculum.

- [Interaction Model](epoch-1-foundation/interaction-model.md): Detailed philosophy on touch interactions.

## Epoch 2: The Builder & Architect (`epoch-2-builder/`)

Phases 7-21: Empowering users to create content.

- [Level Builder](epoch-2-builder/level-builder.md): Detailed design for the Level Builder and Campaign tools.
- [Layout Refinement](epoch-2-builder/layout-refinement.md): Evolution of the UI layout (Phase 14).
- [Testing Philosophy](epoch-2-builder/testing-philosophy.md): Strategy for QA and automated testing (Phase 12).

## Epoch 3: Refinement & Expansion (`epoch-3-refinement/`)

Phases 22-36: Mobile polish, variables, cloud sync, and advanced features.

- [Variables & Memory](epoch-3-refinement/variables-and-memory.md): Design for the "Thought Bubble" and variable system (Phase 25).
- [Targeting & Assets](epoch-3-refinement/targeting-and-assets.md): Refinement of the targeting system (Phase 26).
- [Targeting Workflow](epoch-3-refinement/targeting-workflow.md): Detailed workflow for selecting targets (Phase 26).

## Epoch 4: Advanced Mechanics & Community (`epoch-4-advanced/`)

Phases 37+: New mechanics, community features, and accessibility.

_(Design documents for this epoch will be added here)_

## Process & Analysis (`process/`)

Living records of our development process.
