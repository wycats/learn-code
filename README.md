# Kibi: The Thinking Magic Engine

**Kibi** is a "Thinking Magic" engine designed to teach computational thinking to pre-readers (ages 3-6) through a tactile, diegetic interface. It is not just a coding game; it is a **digital playground** where the rules of logic are as tangible as the blocks in a toy chest.

## The Vision

We believe that coding is the closest thing we have to real magic. It is the ability to speak a language that the world (the computer) understands and obeys. In Kibi, we strip away the syntax and the screens full of text to reveal the _structure_ of that magic.

See [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) for the full vision.

## The Narrative: The Kibi Chronicles

The experience is framed as a dialogue between two modes of thinking, personified by our protagonists:

- **Zoey (The Explorer)**: She represents the **Runtime**. She is eager, active, and lives in the moment. She wants to _do_. She runs the code.
- **Jonas (The Architect)**: He represents the **Editor**. He is thoughtful, structural, and sees the big picture. He wants to _build_. He writes the code.
